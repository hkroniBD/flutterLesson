### **Session 26: Continuous Integration - Continuous Deployment (CI-CD)**

#### **Objective:**
This session will cover the concepts of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), and demonstrate how to set up CI/CD pipelines for Flutter applications using popular tools like GitHub Actions, Bitrise, and Codemagic. The focus will be on automating testing, building, and deployment processes to streamline development workflows.

---

### **1. Introduction to CI/CD Concepts**

**a. Understanding CI/CD:**

   - **Continuous Integration (CI):**
     - Regularly merging code changes into a shared repository.
     - Automated testing to ensure that code changes do not break the application.

   - **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
     - Automatically deploying code changes to production after successful integration and testing.
     - Streamlines the release process by reducing manual steps.

**b. Benefits of CI/CD:**

   - **Faster Development:**
     - Reduces time spent on manual testing and deployment.

   - **Improved Quality:**
     - Automated tests help catch issues early in the development cycle.

   - **Consistent Deployment:**
     - Ensures that deployments are reproducible and consistent.

   - **Faster Feedback:**
     - Provides immediate feedback on code changes, improving development efficiency.

### **2. Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines for Flutter**

**a. GitHub Actions:**

   - **Introduction:**
     - GitHub Actions allows you to automate workflows directly in GitHub repositories.

   - **Setting Up:**
     - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your Flutter project.
     - Add a YAML file for your workflow, e.g., `flutter_ci_cd.yml`.

   - **Example Workflow Configuration:**
     ```yaml
     name: Flutter CI/CD

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - name: Set up Flutter
             uses: subosito/flutter-action@v3
             with:
               flutter-version: '3.0.0'
           - name: Install dependencies
             run: flutter pub get
           - name: Run tests
             run: flutter test
           - name: Build APK
             run: flutter build apk --release
           - name: Upload APK
             uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
             with:
               name: flutter-apk
               path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
     ```

   - **Steps:**
     - **Checkout Code:** Uses `actions/checkout` to clone your repository.
     - **Set Up Flutter:** Uses `subosito/flutter-action` to install the Flutter SDK.
     - **Install Dependencies:** Runs `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
     - **Run Tests:** Executes `flutter test` to run unit and widget tests.
     - **Build APK:** Compiles the release APK.
     - **Upload APK:** Uploads the APK as an artifact.

**b. Bitrise:**

   - **Introduction:**
     - Bitrise is a CI/CD service specifically designed for mobile apps.

   - **Setting Up:**
     - Create a Bitrise account and connect your Flutter project repository.
     - Configure the Bitrise workflow using the Bitrise CLI or the web interface.

   - **Example Workflow Configuration:**
     - Bitrise uses a visual workflow editor to define steps like installing dependencies, running tests, and building the app.

   - **Basic Workflow Steps:**
     1. **Git Clone:** Checks out your code from the repository.
     2. **Flutter Install:** Sets up the Flutter SDK.
     3. **Flutter Dependencies:** Runs `flutter pub get`.
     4. **Flutter Test:** Executes `flutter test`.
     5. **Flutter Build:** Builds the APK or IPA.
     6. **Deploy:** Uploads the build artifacts.

**c. Codemagic:**

   - **Introduction:**
     - Codemagic is a CI/CD tool tailored for Flutter apps with a focus on simplicity.

   - **Setting Up:**
     - Sign up for Codemagic and connect your Flutter repository.
     - Configure the build and deployment process through the Codemagic dashboard.

   - **Example Configuration:**
     - Codemagic uses a YAML configuration file to define the build process.
     - Example configuration in `codemagic.yaml`:
       ```yaml
       version: 2.0

       workflows:
         flutter-workflow:
           name: Flutter Workflow
           instance_type: mac_mini
           steps:
             - checkout
             - flutter-install:
                 version: '3.0.0'
             - pub-get
             - test
             - build:
                 ios: true
                 android: true
             - deploy:
                 artifacts:
                   - build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
                   - build/ios/ipa/Runner.ipa
       ```

   - **Steps:**
     - **Checkout:** Checks out your code.
     - **Flutter Install:** Installs the Flutter SDK.
     - **Pub Get:** Fetches dependencies.
     - **Test:** Runs the tests.
     - **Build:** Builds the APK and IPA.
     - **Deploy:** Uploads the build artifacts.
