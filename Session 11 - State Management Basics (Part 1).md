### **Session 11: State Management Basics - Part 1**

#### **Objective:**
This session introduces fundamental state management concepts in Flutter, focusing on understanding state, using `StatefulWidget` and `setState()`, and managing ephemeral state within widgets.

---

### **1. Understanding State in Flutter**

**a. What is State?**

- **State** refers to the data or information that a widget can hold and modify. In Flutter, state determines how a widget appears and behaves. Widgets can be either **stateless** or **stateful**:
  - **Stateless Widgets:** Do not hold state; they are immutable and build once.
  - **Stateful Widgets:** Can hold state; they can rebuild and update dynamically based on user interactions or data changes.

- **References:**
  - [Flutter Stateless vs Stateful Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro)

**b. Example:**

- **Stateless Widget:**
  ```dart
  class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Center(
        child: Text('I am a stateless widget'),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

- **Stateful Widget:**
  ```dart
  class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
  }

  class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Center(
        child: Text('I am a stateful widget'),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### **2. Introduction to StatefulWidget and setState()**

**a. `StatefulWidget` Overview**

- **StatefulWidget**: This widget is used when the state of a widget changes dynamically. It has a mutable state that is stored in a `State` object. 

**b. `setState()` Method**

- **`setState()`**: This method is used to notify the Flutter framework that the internal state of the widget has changed, and it needs to rebuild the widget with the updated state.

- **Example:**

  ```dart
  class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
  }

  class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
    int _counter = 0;

    void _incrementCounter() {
      setState(() {
        _counter++;
      });
    }

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          Text('Button pressed $_counter times'),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _incrementCounter,
            child: Text('Increment'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### **3. Managing Ephemeral State Within Widgets**

**a. What is Ephemeral State?**

- **Ephemeral State** refers to state that is temporary and only relevant to a specific widget. It is used to manage small amounts of state that do not need to be shared across multiple widgets.

**b. Example:**

- **Managing Ephemeral State:**
  ```dart
  class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
  }

  class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
    int _counter = 0;

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          Text('Counter: $_counter'),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              setState(() {
                _counter++;
              });
            },
            child: Text('Increment'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### **Assignments**

#### **Assignment 1: Implement a Stateful Widget**

- **Objective:** Create a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of `StatefulWidget` and `setState()`.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a StatefulWidget that contains a counter.
  2. Use `setState()` to update the counter when a button is pressed.

#### **Assignment 2: Ephemeral State Management**

- **Objective:** Implement a widget that manages ephemeral state within itself.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a widget that changes its appearance or behavior based on user interaction.
  2. Ensure that the state is not shared with other widgets.

### **Conclusion**

Session 11 introduces fundamental concepts of state management in Flutter, including the use of `StatefulWidget` and `setState()`. Understanding how to manage ephemeral state within widgets is crucial for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Mastery of these concepts will form the foundation for more advanced state management techniques covered in subsequent sessions.
