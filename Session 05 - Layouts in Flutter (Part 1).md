### **Session 5: Layouts in Flutter - Part 1**

#### **Objective:**
This session focuses on understanding layout constraints in Flutter and introduces key layout widgets such as `Flex`, `Expanded`, `Flexible`, `Row`, `Column`, and `Stack`. These concepts are essential for creating responsive and well-structured UIs.

### **1. Understanding Layout Constraints**

**a. Layout Constraints Overview:**

- **Definition:**
  - Layout constraints in Flutter define how widgets should be sized and positioned within their parent widgets. Flutter uses a constraint-based layout system where each widget receives constraints from its parent and must size itself accordingly.

- **Constraint Types:**
  - **Tight Constraints:** The parent widget specifies exact dimensions (width and height) for the child widget.
  - **Loose Constraints:** The parent widget specifies a range of acceptable dimensions for the child widget, allowing it to choose its size within that range.

- **References:**
  - [Flutter Layout Constraints](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/constraints)

**b. Flexibility in Layout:**

- **Flex:** A widget that arranges its children in a horizontal or vertical line and allows them to resize proportionally.
- **Expanded:** A widget that expands to fill available space in a `Flex` container.
- **Flexible:** A widget that can flexibly adjust its size within a `Flex` container but allows other widgets to occupy space as well.

### **2. Using Flex, Expanded, and Flexible Widgets**

**a. Flex Widget:**

- **Definition:**
  - `Flex` is a base class for `Row` and `Column` that arranges children along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).

- **Syntax:**
  ```dart
  Flex(
    direction: Axis.horizontal, // Or Axis.vertical
    children: <Widget>[
      Container(color: Colors.red, width: 100),
      Container(color: Colors.green, width: 100),
    ],
  )
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Flex Widget Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout#flex)

**b. Expanded Widget:**

- **Definition:**
  - `Expanded` is used within a `Flex` container to take up available space along the main axis. It can be used to fill the remaining space after other children have been laid out.

- **Syntax:**
  ```dart
  Expanded(
    child: Container(color: Colors.blue),
  )
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Expanded Widget Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout#expanded)

**c. Flexible Widget:**

- **Definition:**
  - `Flexible` allows a widget to take up a portion of space in a `Flex` container. It can adjust its size based on the `flex` property and other flexible widgets in the same container.

- **Syntax:**
  ```dart
  Flexible(
    flex: 2,
    child: Container(color: Colors.yellow),
  )
  ```

  - [Flexible Widget Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout#flexible)

### **3. Creating Simple Layouts with Row, Column, and Stack**

**a. Row Widget:**

- **Definition:**
  - `Row` arranges its children horizontally. Each child is laid out from left to right, and the main axis is horizontal.

- **Syntax:**
  ```dart
  Row(
    children: <Widget>[
      Container(color: Colors.red, width: 50, height: 50),
      Container(color: Colors.green, width: 50, height: 50),
    ],
  )
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Row Widget Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout#row)

**b. Column Widget:**

- **Definition:**
  - `Column` arranges its children vertically. Each child is laid out from top to bottom, and the main axis is vertical.

- **Syntax:**
  ```dart
  Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      Container(color: Colors.red, width: 50, height: 50),
      Container(color: Colors.green, width: 50, height: 50),
    ],
  )
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Column Widget Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout#column)

**c. Stack Widget:**

- **Definition:**
  - `Stack` allows you to overlay widgets on top of each other. Children are positioned relative to the edges of the `Stack`, and the most recently added widget is on top.

- **Syntax:**
  ```dart
  Stack(
    children: <Widget>[
      Container(color: Colors.red, width: 100, height: 100),
      Positioned(
        left: 20,
        top: 20,
        child: Container(color: Colors.blue, width: 50, height: 50),
      ),
    ],
  )
  ```

### **Assignments**

#### **Assignment 1: Layout Constraints Practice**

- **Objective:** Understand how layout constraints work in Flutter and practice using different layout widgets.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a `Flex` container with two children. Use `Expanded` and `Flexible` to control how space is distributed between the children.
  2. Build a simple `Row` and `Column` layout with multiple `Container` widgets. Experiment with alignment and spacing.

#### **Assignment 2: Building with Stack**

- **Objective:** Use the `Stack` widget to create layered UI elements.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a `Stack` with a background image and overlay it with a `Container` that displays some text.
  2. Position widgets using the `Positioned` widget within the `Stack` to create a layered design.

### **Quiz**

1. **What is the primary purpose of the `Expanded` widget in Flutter?**
   - a) To arrange widgets vertically
   - b) To take up remaining space in a `Flex` container
   - c) To wrap widgets with padding
   - d) To display an image

2. **How does the `Flexible` widget differ from the `Expanded` widget?**
   - a) `Flexible` allows other widgets to share space, while `Expanded` takes all available space.
   - b) `Expanded` is used for horizontal layouts, while `Flexible` is used for vertical layouts.
   - c) `Flexible` is used for text, while `Expanded` is used for images.
   - d) There is no difference between `Flexible` and `Expanded`.

3. **Which widget would you use to overlay widgets on top of each other?**
   - a) `Column`
   - b) `Row`
   - c) `Stack`
   - d) `GridView`

4. **What layout widget arranges children in a horizontal line?**
   - a) `Column`
   - b) `Row`
   - c) `Stack`
   - d) `Flex`

5. **Which property of the `Flex` widget determines the direction of the layout?**
