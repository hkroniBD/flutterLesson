### **Session 12: State Management Basics - Part 2**

#### **Objective:**
This session focuses on advanced state management techniques in Flutter, including lifting state up to share it between widgets, using `InheritedWidget` for state sharing, and discussing best practices for managing state in small to medium-sized apps.

---

### **1. Lifting State Up: Sharing State Between Widgets**

**a. What is Lifting State Up?**

- **Lifting State Up** involves moving state to a common ancestor widget so that multiple child widgets can share and interact with this state. This is useful when different widgets need to read or modify the same state.

**b. Example:**

- **Scenario:** Consider a parent widget that maintains the state of a counter and passes it down to two child widgets: one to display the counter and another to increment it.

- **Code:**

  ```dart
  class ParentWidget extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _ParentWidgetState createState() => _ParentWidgetState();
  }

  class _ParentWidgetState extends State<ParentWidget> {
    int _counter = 0;

    void _incrementCounter() {
      setState(() {
        _counter++;
      });
    }

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          Text('Counter: $_counter'),
          IncrementButton(onPressed: _incrementCounter),
        ],
      );
    }
  }

  class IncrementButton extends StatelessWidget {
    final VoidCallback onPressed;

    IncrementButton({required this.onPressed});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: onPressed,
        child: Text('Increment'),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### **2. Introduction to InheritedWidget for State Sharing**

**a. What is InheritedWidget?**

- **InheritedWidget** is a special type of widget that allows data to be efficiently propagated down the widget tree. It is designed to share data across multiple widgets that need access to the same state without explicitly passing data through constructors.

**b. How It Works:**

- **Create an InheritedWidget Subclass:** Define a custom `InheritedWidget` that holds the state you want to share.

- **Access the State:** Use the `of` method to access the shared data from any widget that is a descendant of the `InheritedWidget`.

- **Example:**

  ```dart
  class MyInheritedWidget extends InheritedWidget {
    final int counter;
    final VoidCallback incrementCounter;

    MyInheritedWidget({
      Key? key,
      required this.counter,
      required this.incrementCounter,
      required Widget child,
    }) : super(key: key, child: child);

    static MyInheritedWidget? of(BuildContext context) {
      return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyInheritedWidget>();
    }

    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(MyInheritedWidget oldWidget) {
      return counter != oldWidget.counter;
    }
  }

  class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final inheritedWidget = MyInheritedWidget.of(context);

      return Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          Text('Counter: ${inheritedWidget?.counter ?? 0}'),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: inheritedWidget?.incrementCounter,
            child: Text('Increment'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    }
  }

  class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      int counter = 0;

      void incrementCounter() {
        counter++;
      }

      return MyInheritedWidget(
        counter: counter,
        incrementCounter: incrementCounter,
        child: MyWidget(),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### **3. Best Practices for Managing State in Small to Medium-Sized Apps**

**a. Use Stateless Widgets Where Possible**

- Prefer **StatelessWidget** for widgets that do not need to manage mutable state, as they are easier to reason about and test.

**b. Lift State Up When Necessary**

- If multiple widgets need access to the same state, lift the state up to a common ancestor to ensure a single source of truth.

**c. Consider Using InheritedWidget for Complex State Sharing**

- Use **InheritedWidget** for efficient state sharing in larger widget trees where multiple widgets need to access the same state.

**d. Manage State Locally When Possible**

- For simple use cases, manage state within individual widgets to keep the code straightforward and maintainable.

**e. Avoid Overusing Global State**

- Be cautious about using global state management solutions prematurely. Start with simpler approaches and introduce more complex state management solutions like `Provider` or `Bloc` as needed.

### **Assignments**

#### **Assignment 1: Implement State Sharing**

- **Objective:** Create a Flutter application demonstrating state sharing between multiple widgets using the lifting state up approach.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a parent widget that manages a counter state.
  2. Pass the state and state management functions to child widgets.

#### **Assignment 2: Use InheritedWidget**

- **Objective:** Implement a custom `InheritedWidget` to share state across multiple widgets in a Flutter app.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Define an `InheritedWidget` that holds the state.
  2. Access the shared state from descendant widgets using the `of` method.
