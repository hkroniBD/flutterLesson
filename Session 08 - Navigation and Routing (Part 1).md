### **Session 8: Navigation and Routing - Part 1**

#### **Objective:**
This session introduces navigation and routing in Flutter, focusing on basic navigation techniques, passing data between screens, and understanding the core concepts behind Flutter's navigation system.

---

### **1. Introduction to Navigation and Routing in Flutter**

**a. Overview of Navigation:**

- **Definition:**
  - Navigation refers to the process of moving between different screens or routes in a Flutter application. Flutter uses the `Navigator` widget to manage routes and navigation.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Route:** Represents a screen or page in your app.
  - **Navigator:** A widget that manages a stack of routes and provides methods to push and pop routes.

- **References:**
  - [Flutter Navigation Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation)

**b. Route Management:**

- **Named Routes vs. Anonymous Routes:**
  - **Named Routes:** Routes are registered with a name in the appâ€™s route table and navigated to using that name.
  - **Anonymous Routes:** Routes are defined inline and used immediately.

- **References:**
  - [Named Routes Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/named-routes)
  - [Anonymous Routes Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/route-arguments)

### **2. Implementing Simple Navigation with `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pop`**

**a. Navigating to a New Screen:**

- **Definition:**
  - Use `Navigator.push` to navigate to a new route and add it to the stack.

- **Syntax Example:**
  ```dart
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
  );
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Navigator Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation#navigator)

**b. Returning to the Previous Screen:**

- **Definition:**
  - Use `Navigator.pop` to remove the top route from the stack and return to the previous screen.

- **Syntax Example:**
  ```dart
  Navigator.pop(context);
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Navigator.pop Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation#pop)

### **3. Passing Data Between Screens**

**a. Passing Data Using Constructor Parameters:**

- **Definition:**
  - You can pass data to a new screen by including parameters in the constructor of the destination screen.

- **Syntax Example:**
  ```dart
  // FirstScreen.dart
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => SecondScreen(data: 'Hello from FirstScreen'),
    ),
  );
  
  // SecondScreen.dart
  class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
    final String data;

    SecondScreen({required this.data});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Second Screen'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(data),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

- **References:**
  - [Passing Data Between Screens Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/route-arguments)

**b. Using `Navigator` and `ModalRoute` to Retrieve Data:**

- **Definition:**
  - Use `ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments` to retrieve arguments passed to a route.

- **Syntax Example:**
  ```dart
  // FirstScreen.dart
  Navigator.pushNamed(
    context,
    '/second',
    arguments: 'Hello from FirstScreen',
  );
  
  // SecondScreen.dart
  class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final String data = ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments as String;

      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Second Screen'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(data),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### **Assignments**

#### **Assignment 1: Basic Navigation**

- **Objective:** Implement basic navigation between two screens.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Create two screens: `HomeScreen` and `DetailsScreen`.
  2. Implement a button on `HomeScreen` that navigates to `DetailsScreen` using `Navigator.push`.
  3. Add a button on `DetailsScreen` that returns to `HomeScreen` using `Navigator.pop`.

#### **Assignment 2: Passing Data Between Screens**

- **Objective:** Pass data from one screen to another.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Modify the `DetailsScreen` to accept a string parameter in its constructor.
  2. Pass a string value from `HomeScreen` to `DetailsScreen` when navigating.
  3. Display the passed string on `DetailsScreen`.
